For each given program give the code and the output in your submission

QUESTION 1:

Read on the following
1. The mid-point circle drawing algorithm
2. bresenhams-circle-algorithm
3. Color drawing in open GL

a) Using the two algorithms above and OpenGL, write a
program that draws a circle centered at point (3,3) and has
a radius 4 cms . Ensure that the circle is drawn using the red
color

b) Draw the straight line that cuts as diameter to the circle and
show the program that outputs the circle in red and the
diameter in black color

QUESTION 2:

Read on the following
1. The mid-point ellipse drawing algorithm
2. bresenhams- ellipse -algorithm
3. Color drawing in open GL

Using the two algorithms above and OpenGL, write a program
that draws an ellipse centered at point (0,0) and is green in
color

QUESTION 3

1. Write an OpenGL project to draw a square with coordinates
(-3,5), (0,-4), (3,7), and (6,-2) in blue color
2. Write a program to rotate the triangle anticlockwise 48 degrees
but leave a shadow square in dotted red lines in the original
location
3. Write a program to scale the rotated square by a factor of 2
4. Reflect the square across the Y- axis
