Consider the following starting and
ending points respectively
1. (-2, 2) and (3,7)
2. (0,3) and (6,5)
a) Illustrate step by step actions to be
taken by the following five line
drawing algorithms namely
i. DDA
ii. Midpoint line drawing
algorithm
iii. Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm
iv. Gupta-Sproull algorithm
v. Bresenhamâ€™s LineDrawing
Algorithm
b) Implement the following Five
algorithms to plot the line points
given above in OpenGL
Note :
The lines should have points as
blue hashes # to mark the points
and the line be red in color .
